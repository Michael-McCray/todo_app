# GraphQL Hooks Example

 This was created using 'graphql-hooks'. Basic functionality is achieved in a similar way to 'Apollo' and should cover a fair amount of use cases.

## How to use

### Install

Execute [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) with [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/init) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/cli/create/) to bootstrap the example:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Michael-McCray/todo_app.git
cd yarn install
```

### Run

```bash
yarn dev
```
